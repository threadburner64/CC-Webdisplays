# CC-Webdisplays

Made this because Webdisplays is not ready for 1.16.5
# Server Setup

A library, xvfbwrapper is only made for linux which allows fast-screenshotting
Therefore the server will only work on linux systems , try with windows wsl if on windows

Please install python3 and the libraries with pip or pip3

apt install python3

apt install python3-pip

pip install fastapi xvfbwrapper selenium pillow-simd uvicorn

pip3 install fastapi xvfbwrapper selenium pillow-simd uvicorn

If you have pillow, not simd version then it remove with pip

SIMD version is more faster 

Download the server here, includes chrome binary all in zip file
