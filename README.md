# CC-Webdisplays

Made this because Webdisplays is not ready for 1.16.5
# Server Setup

A library, xvfbwrapper is only made for linux which allows fast-screenshotting
Therefore this will only work on linux systems , try with windows wsl if on windows

Please install python3 and the libraries with pip or pip3

pip install fastapi xvfbwrapper selenium pillow-simd uvicorn

pip3 install fastapi xvfbwrapper selenium pillow-simd uvicorn

If you have pillow, not simd version then it remove with pip

SIMD version is more faster
